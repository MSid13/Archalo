# Archalo 🏺

**Your comprehensive guide to archaeological discovery and responsible artifact reporting.**


## 📖 About

Archalo is a web platform developed by the **FLL Owlcheologists Team #41991** to bridge the gap between archaeological discovery and proper reporting procedures. When someone discovers an artifact, they often don't know what to do next. Archalo provides instant, location-specific guidance on who to contact and what steps to take.

### Mission
To empower the public to protect cultural heritage by simplifying the process of reporting archaeological finds and providing essential legal and educational resources.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 I Found an Artifact Tool

- **Property lookup**: Integrates with parcel data APIs to determine jurisdiction
- **Smart matching system**: 4-tier fallback system for finding relevant contacts
  - Tier 1: Specific property owner (e.g., National Park Service)
  - Tier 2: County/jurisdiction match
  - Tier 2.5: State-level fallback
  - Tier 3: Default national guidance
- **Contact information**: Displays relevant archaeological authorities with phone, email, and special instructions
- **Interactive maps**: Shows property boundaries using Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap
- **Historical timelines**: Displays property and regional history for context
